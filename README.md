# Kernel Divergence Score

Official implementation of ICML 2025 paper, "[How Contaminated Is Your Benchmark? Measuring Dataset Leakage in Large Language Models with Kernel Divergence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00678)" by Hyeong Kyu Choi*, Maxim Khanov*, Hongxin Wei, and Yixuan Li.

## Setup Environment
```
git clone https://github.com/deeplearning-wisc/kernel-divergence-score.git
cd kernel-divergence-score
```

```
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate kds
```

Finally, create a "token" file right outside the ```src/``` directory (note that there shouldn't be any extension in the file name), containing your huggingface credential token.


## Experiments

Experiment commands are in ```scripts/```. Each shell file computes the kernel divergence scores for contamination rate 0.0~1.0 on seed 0.
